Real Mouse Trap - 3D game restoration project

After 20 years I have found this piece of C++ code on a rusty DVD. This was my first finished work because it was my thesis in the programmer school where I was belonged to. It's a simple DOS game fitted for a 1.4 Mb floppy disc. As I remember, the concept was simple: make a Wolfenstein remake for kids without any political relevancies, guns, or any blood. The work has taken about three months and made it alone. At that time I had not many programming experiences but I was determined.  Just like now :)

Now, when the DOS is dead this game is unusable too. But the concept and the vibe of this visual appearance are deserved a second chance as I believe.

So I decided that I will renovate this junk of legacy codes to build something usable from it. I'll keep the original 320x200 resolution and the pictures but the new target op system will be Linux using SDL (Simple Media Layer). Firstly I think I'll replace Borland's project system with CMake or something similar.

Anway, "Have a lot of fun! " - as I said for myself two decades ago.
