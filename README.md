## Real Mouse Trap - 3D game restoration project

After 20 years I found this piece of C++ code on a rusty DVD. This was my first finished work because it was my thesis in my programmer college. It's a simple DOS game fitted for a 1.4 Mb floppy disc. As far as I remember, my concept was quite simple: make a Wolfenstein remake for kids without any political connotations, guns, or any blood / remarkable violence. The work had taken about three months and I made it on my own. At that time I did'nt have any programming experiences but I was determined. Just like now :)

Now, when DOS is dead, this game is unusable too. But I still believe, that the concept and the vibe of this visual appearance deserve a second chance.

So I decided to renovate this junk of legacy codes to build something usable from it. I'll keep the original 320x200 resolution and the pictures but the new target op system will be Linux using SDL (Simple Media Layer). Firstly I think I'll replace Borland's project system with CMake or something similar.

Anyway, "Have a lot of fun! " - as I said for myself two decades ago.
